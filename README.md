365 DataScience Customer Churn Analysis with SQL and Tableau
## Customer Behavior Analysis Project
# Description
Analyzing customer behavior based on data is becoming necessary for any business to understand its consumer base. In this project, you’ll learn how to define and analyze customer churn metrics, such as customer retention rate, customer re-subscription rate, customer lifetime value, and more. We’ll work with a real database, query it using MySQL, and create a Tableau dashboard based on the customer data. You’ll learn how to create maps and cohort tables, use Tableau filters, and more

# **Customer Behavior Analytics: Churn and Retention Metrics**

## Overview
In this project, you'll learn how to define and analyze customer churn metrics, such as customer retention rate, re-subscription rate, and customer lifetime value. You will work with a real customer database, query it using **MySQL**, and create powerful **Tableau** dashboards to visualize and interpret key customer data. 

By the end of this project , you'll have the skills to analyze customer behavior, segment users, and create dynamic visualizations, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions and improve customer retention strategies.

### **Learning Outcomes**:
- **Customer Retention Rate**: Measure the percentage of customers who continue using the service over time.
- **Customer Re-subscription Rate**: Understand how often customers return after churn.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Calculate the total revenue a customer generates during their relationship with a business.
- **Churn Analysis**: Identify trends and reasons behind customer attrition.
- **Cohort Analysis**: Segment users into cohorts to track retention and engagement over time.
- **Data Visualization**: Build dynamic **Tableau dashboards** using customer behavior data.

### **Tools & Technologies**:
- **MySQL**: For querying and managing customer data.
- **Tableau**: For creating data visualizations, including maps, cohort tables, and interactive dashboards.

## Getting Started



### 2. **Install Dependencies**:
Tools Required
List any tools or dependencies required to run the project.

## MySQL
## Tableau

### **3. Data Analysis & Visualization in Tableau**:
Using **Tableau**, you will:
- Create interactive dashboards to visualize churn rates, retention, and customer lifetime value.
- Build **cohort analysis tables** to track customer behavior over time.
- Use **maps** to visualize customer distribution by region.

You will create various types of visualizations, including:
- **Bar Charts**: To visualize churn rates and retention metrics.
- **Cohort Tables**: To analyze how different customer groups behave over time.
- **Maps**: To see customer distribution across geographic regions.

## Visualizations

### Key Dashboards:
- **Churn Analysis**: A **bar chart** showing customer churn rate over different periods (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Visualize the long-term value of customers using a **line chart** or **scatter plot**.
- **Cohort Analysis**: Visualize how customer retention changes over time, segmented by the month of first purchase.

Sample visualizations:
- **Churn Rate Visualization**:
  

- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**:
